* What Is OPSX?

OPSX is OpenSpec's workflow engine. It replaces the old "linear
phases" approach with a fluid, action-based system where you can
do anything at any time.

** The Core Idea

Instead of being locked into rigid phases (plan → implement →
archive), OPSX gives you /actions/ you can invoke whenever they
make sense. Under the hood, artifacts form a dependency graph
(DAG), not a pipeline:

#+begin_example
  proposal ──→ specs  ──┐
      │                  ├──→ tasks ──→ implement
      └──→ design ──────┘
#+end_example

Each artifact becomes "ready" when its dependencies are "done"
(i.e., the files exist on disk). You can always go back and edit
any artifact — the system adapts.

** Philosophy: Actions, Not Phases

Traditional workflows lock you into phases — planning, then
implementation, then done. Real work does not fit neatly into
boxes.

#+begin_example
Traditional (phase-locked):

  PLANNING ────────► IMPLEMENTING ────────► DONE
      │                    │
      │   "Can't go back"  │
      └────────────────────┘

OPSX (fluid actions):

  proposal ──► specs ──► design ──► tasks ──► implement
#+end_example

Key principles:
- *Actions, not phases* — Commands are things you can /do/,
  not stages you are stuck in.
- *Dependencies are enablers* — They show what is possible,
  not what is required next.

OPSX workflows are driven by /schemas/ that define artifact
sequences. You can create custom schemas to match your team's
style (see the Customization section).

** The Four Personas

OPSX works with four agent personas, each responsible for a
different concern:

| Persona              | Role                                    | Produces      |
|----------------------+-----------------------------------------+---------------|
| Requirements Analyst | Interviews you, eliminates ambiguity    | =proposal.md= |
| Solution Architect   | Reads proposal, designs the solution    | =design.md=   |
| Developer            | Implements tasks via TDD, small commits | Working code  |
| Reviewer             | Audits commits, enforces standards      | =comments.md= |

You do not manually switch between these personas. The OPSX
commands invoke the appropriate behaviour based on the action.

** The Commands

| Command              | What It Does                                         |
|----------------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| ~/opsx:explore~      | Think through ideas freely. No structure imposed.    |
| ~/opsx:new~          | Start a new change. Creates scaffold.                |
| ~/opsx:continue~     | Create the next artifact (based on what is ready).   |
| ~/opsx:ff~           | Fast-forward: create all planning artifacts at once. |
| ~/opsx:apply~        | Implement tasks. Update artifacts if design changes. |
| ~/opsx:sync~         | Sync delta specs to main specs.                      |
| ~/opsx:archive~      | Archive completed work.                              |
| ~/opsx:verify~       | Verify implementation matches change artifacts.      |
| ~/opsx:bulk-archive~ | Archive multiple completed changes at once.          |

* Conflict with the set up of the personas
** Friction with the 4 personas

The personas in =./personas/= and the OPSX workflow solve the same
problem — structured AI collaboration — but they are different
implementations of it.

*** What each system does

The persona files (=analyst.md=, =architect.md=, =developer.md=,
=reviewer.md=) are *raw system prompts*. You switch between them
manually by restarting Claude with =--system-prompt-file
personas/architect.md=. Each file defines a role's goals, rules, and
expected outputs. They are self-contained and stateless — they know
nothing about each other's outputs.

OPSX is a *command layer on top of Claude Code*. The commands
(=/opsx:new=, =/opsx:ff=, =/opsx:apply=, …) trigger skill files in
=.claude/skills/= that internally embody persona behaviour. The agent
switches roles automatically based on which command you invoke.
Artifact files on disk act as the shared state between roles.

*** The mapping

The four personas map directly to OPSX commands:

| Persona file   | OPSX equivalent      | Triggered by                            |
|----------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| =analyst.md=   | Requirements Analyst | =/opsx:explore=, first =/opsx:continue= |
| =architect.md= | Solution Architect   | =/opsx:ff=, subsequent =/opsx:continue= |
| =developer.md= | Developer            | =/opsx:apply=                           |
| =reviewer.md=  | Reviewer             | =/opsx:verify=                          |

*** The concrete mismatch

The persona files have hardcoded project specifics that conflict with
OPSX conventions:

1. =analyst.md= outputs =specs/requirements.md= — OPSX expects
   =proposal.md= and =specs/<domain>/spec.md= inside the change folder.
2. =architect.md= reads =specs/requirements.md= and writes
   =specs/design.md= — OPSX expects =design.md= inside the change
   folder, not the global =specs/= directory.
3. Both analyst and architect files embed Book Tracker specifics (phases,
   tech stack, XState, dotenvx) directly in the instructions — these
   would need to be extracted to be reusable across projects.
4. The personas are activated by restarting the session; OPSX skills are
   invoked within one continuing session via slash commands.

*** Two paths forward

*Path A — Manual persona switching alongside OPSX (low effort)*

Keep both systems. Use OPSX for command structure and artifact
tracking. When a role needs deep domain context, paste the relevant
sections of the persona file into your conversation message rather
than as a system prompt:

#+begin_example
You: /opsx:continue
     [paste relevant sections from personas/architect.md as context]
#+end_example

Low setup cost, but you lose the clean role separation.

*Path B — Port the personas into the OPSX config (proper integration)*

Extract what each persona knows into the right OPSX-managed locations:

1. *Project-agnostic rules* (coding standards, TDD discipline, review
   criteria) → =openspec/config.yaml= under the =rules:= key. OPSX
   injects these into every agent automatically.

2. *Project-specific constraints* (tech stack, ADRs, file paths) →
   =openspec/config.yaml= under the =context:= key:
   #+begin_src yaml
   context: |
     Tech stack: TanStack Start, node:sqlite, XState, dotenvx
     No Express. Server logic via createServerFn only.
     State: XState for entity lifecycles, useState for trivial UI.
   #+end_src

3. *Role-specific checklists* (Reviewer approval criteria, Developer
   quality gates) → inlined directly into the =context:= block of
   =openspec/config.yaml= so OPSX injects them automatically. Human-
   readable mirrors live in =openspec/standards/= for reference, but
   =config.yaml= is the authoritative source.

4. The persona files then become *conversation supplements* — context
   you can drop in when a role needs extra grounding — rather than full
   system prompts.

*** Path B applied — current state

Path B has been fully applied. All persona knowledge is inlined into
=openspec/config.yaml= and injected by OPSX automatically into every
agent invocation. The persona files are now human reference only.

=openspec/config.yaml= is the single source of truth. Its =context:=
block contains:
- Project description, tech stack, architecture constraints
- ADR decisions (0002–0005)
- Style guide rules (safety, simplicity, naming, comments, performance)
- Developer quality gates (TDD pattern, git workflow, pre-commit gates,
  phase sequence, self-review checklist)
- Review criteria (review workflow, full approval checklist, reviewer
  rules)

#+begin_example
openspec/
├── config.yaml                    ← INJECTED into every agent automatically
└── standards/
    ├── review-checklist.md        ← human reference only (mirrored in config.yaml)
    └── developer-quality-gates.md ← human reference only (mirrored in config.yaml)

personas/
├── analyst.md   ← reference only
├── architect.md ← reference only
├── developer.md ← reference only
└── reviewer.md  ← reference only
#+end_example

What each OPSX command picks up from =config.yaml=:

| Command          | Picks up                                                        |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| =/opsx:explore=  | Full context (project, stack, ADRs, style guide, quality gates) |
| =/opsx:continue= | Full context + =rules.proposal=                                 |
| =/opsx:ff=       | Full context + all =rules= sections                             |
| =/opsx:apply=    | Full context incl. developer quality gates + =rules.tasks=      |
| =/opsx:verify=   | Full context incl. review criteria + =rules= sections           |
| =/opsx:archive=  | Full context                                                    |

Note: if you update =openspec/standards/= files, update =config.yaml=
too — they are kept in sync manually.

*** The one thing to watch

The persona files assume a *linear phase sequence* (Phase 1 → Phase 2
→ … → Phase 6). OPSX's artifact DAG is deliberately non-linear. If you
import the phase plan from =architect.md= directly into =tasks.md=, it
works — =/opsx:apply= will execute the phases sequentially. The tension
only appears if you need to run parallel changes that touch the same
phases, in which case OPSX's model is richer and the persona files
offer no guidance.


* Workflow Patterns

Choose the pattern that matches your situation.

** Pattern 1: Quick Feature

*When to use*: you know what you want to build and just need to
execute. Small to medium features, bug fixes, straightforward
changes.

#+begin_example
/opsx:new ──► /opsx:ff ──► /opsx:apply ──► /opsx:verify ──► /opsx:archive
#+end_example

Example session:
#+begin_example
You:  /opsx:new book-tracker-crud
AI:   Created openspec/changes/book-tracker-crud/
      Ready to create: proposal

You:  /opsx:ff
AI:   ✓ proposal.md  ✓ specs/  ✓ design.md  ✓ tasks.md
      Ready for implementation!

You:  /opsx:apply
AI:   ✓ Phase 2: db.ts schema + createServerFn CRUD
      ✓ Phase 3: book list page with useQuery
      ✓ Phase 4: add book form with mutation

You:  /opsx:archive
AI:   ✓ Merged specs  ✓ Archived change
#+end_example

** Pattern 2: Exploratory

*When to use*: requirements are unclear, you need to investigate
the codebase first, or you want to validate each artifact before
continuing. Performance optimisation, debugging, architectural
decisions.

#+begin_example
/opsx:explore ──► /opsx:new ──► /opsx:continue ──► ... ──► /opsx:apply
#+end_example

Example session:
#+begin_example
You:  /opsx:explore
AI:   What would you like to explore?

You:  I want to add book grouping by theme but I'm not sure
      whether to do it in the DB query or in the UI.

AI:   Let me look at the current db.ts and book list route...
      Two approaches:
      1. SQL GROUP BY theme in the query (simpler, faster)
      2. Client-side grouping in the BookList component (more flexible)
      Your XState machine doesn't need to change either way.
      What does "theme" mean — a free-text tag or a fixed enum?

You:  Free-text tag on the book record.

You:  /opsx:new book-grouping-by-theme

You:  /opsx:continue
AI:   Creating proposal based on our exploration...
      Ready to create: specs, design

You:  /opsx:continue
AI:   Creating specs...
#+end_example

** Pattern 3: Parallel Changes

*When to use*: working on multiple independent features, handling
urgent interrupts, or collaborating across branches.

#+begin_example
Change A: /opsx:new ──► /opsx:ff ──► /opsx:apply (in progress)
                                         │
                                    context switch
                                         │
Change B: /opsx:new ──► /opsx:ff ──────► /opsx:apply
#+end_example

Resume a named change explicitly:
#+begin_example
/opsx:apply book-status-toggle
#+end_example

The agent picks up from the last completed task in
=tasks.md=.

When several changes finish around the same time, batch-archive
them:
#+begin_example
You:  /opsx:bulk-archive
AI:   Found 3 completed changes:
      - book-tracker-crud
      - fix-status-transition
      - book-grouping-by-theme

      ⚠ book-tracker-crud and book-grouping-by-theme both touch specs/books/
      Resolving by chronological order of implementation…

      Archive all 3?

You:  Yes
AI:   ✓ Archived book-tracker-crud
      ✓ Archived fix-status-transition
      ✓ Archived book-grouping-by-theme
#+end_example

Bulk archive detects conflicts when multiple changes touch the
same specs, and resolves them by inspecting what is actually
implemented.

* Before You Start

** Prerequisites

1. Install OpenSpec and initialise:
   #+begin_src bash
     openspec init
   #+end_src
   This creates =.claude/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md= and sets up
   the workflow commands.

2. For this project, =openspec/config.yaml= is already configured.
   The schema, full tech stack context (TanStack Start, node:sqlite,
   XState, dotenvx, ADRs, style guide), developer quality gates, and
   review criteria are all inlined and injected into every agent
   automatically. See =openspec/config.yaml= for the full content.

3. Attach MCP servers (Context7 for docs, Serena for code
   symbols) so agents can search effectively.

** Context Management

🟡 *Critical rule*: run ~/context~ frequently. If you exceed
*100,000 tokens*, exit and restart the session. A bloated context
makes the AI unfocused and error-prone.

* Playbook: Walking Through a Full Cycle

Below is a complete walkthrough of one round of OPSX, from idea
to archived change. Use this as a template.

** Round 1: Explore the Idea
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-explore
:END:

*Goal*: clarify what you want to build before committing to
formal artifacts.

#+begin_example
/opsx:explore
#+end_example

This is a free-form thinking session. Use it to:
- Describe the feature you have in mind.
- Discuss constraints and trade-offs.
- Investigate the codebase (the agent can search code).
- Compare approaches.

*Best practices*:
- Be conversational. Ask "what if" questions.
- Do not worry about structure yet.
- If the idea is clear already, skip to Round 2 or 3.

*Exit criterion*: you can articulate what you want in one or two
sentences. When ready, move on.

** Round 2: Create the Change
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-new
:END:

*Goal*: formalise the change with a name and scaffold.

#+begin_example
/opsx:new my-feature-name
#+end_example

This creates a change directory under =openspec/changes/= with
all artifacts. The structure created looks like this:

#+begin_example
openspec/
├── specs/              # Source of truth (system's current behaviour)
│   └── <domain>/
│       └── spec.md
├── changes/            # Proposed updates (one folder per change)
│   └── <change-name>/
│       ├── proposal.md
│       ├── design.md
│       ├── tasks.md
│       └── specs/      # Delta specs (what is changing)
│           └── <domain>/
│               └── spec.md
└── config.yaml         # Project configuration (optional)
#+end_example

Two key directories:
- *=specs/=* — The source of truth. Describes how your system
  currently behaves. Organised by domain (e.g. =specs/books/=,
  =specs/status/=).
- *=changes/=* — Proposed modifications. Each change gets its
  own folder. When complete, its specs merge into the main
  =specs/= directory.

*Best practices*:
- Pick a short, descriptive name (kebab-case). Examples:
  =book-tracker-crud=, =fix-status-transition=, =book-grouping-by-theme=.
- Keep the description focused. One feature per change.

** Round 3: Build the Planning Artifacts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-plan
:END:

*Goal*: produce the proposal, specs, design, and tasks.

Each artifact builds on those before it:

#+begin_example
proposal ──► specs ──► design ──► tasks ──► implement
   ▲           ▲          ▲                    │
   └───────────┴──────────┴────────────────────┘
            update as you learn
#+end_example

You can always go back and refine earlier artifacts as
implementation teaches you more.

You have two strategies:

*** Strategy A: Fast-Forward (clear vision)

When you already know what you want:

#+begin_example
/opsx:ff
#+end_example

Creates *all* planning artifacts in one go:
- =proposal.md= — high-level goals and success criteria.
- =specs/= — detailed requirements per capability.
- =design.md= — technical architecture, components, schemas.
- =tasks.md= — implementation checklist with phases.

Use this when you have discussed the idea enough (e.g., after
a thorough =/opsx:explore= session) and want to move fast.

*** Strategy B: Incremental (exploring as you go)

When you want to validate each step:

#+begin_example
/opsx:continue
#+end_example

Creates *one* artifact at a time, following the dependency
graph:
1. First call → creates =proposal.md= (no dependencies).
2. Second call → creates =specs/= (requires proposal).
3. Third call → creates =design.md= (requires proposal).
4. Fourth call → creates =tasks.md= (requires specs + design).

After each artifact, review it. Edit if something is off. Then
call =/opsx:continue= again.

*Choosing between the two strategies*:

| Situation                                 | Use              |
|-------------------------------------------+------------------|
| Clear requirements, ready to build        | =/opsx:ff=       |
| Exploring, want to review each step       | =/opsx:continue= |
| Want to iterate on proposal before specs  | =/opsx:continue= |
| Time pressure, need to move fast          | =/opsx:ff=       |
| Complex change, want fine-grained control | =/opsx:continue= |

*Rule of thumb*: if you can describe the full scope upfront,
use =/opsx:ff=. If you are figuring it out as you go, use
=/opsx:continue=.

*Best practices*:
- Read each artifact as it is created. Fix issues immediately.
- If the AI misunderstood something, edit the artifact and re-run
  =/opsx:continue=. The system re-evaluates from the updated
  state.
- Check status anytime with:
  #+begin_src bash
  openspec status --change "my-feature-name"
  #+end_src

** Understanding Delta Specs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: delta-specs
:END:

Delta specs live in =openspec/changes/<name>/specs/= and
describe what is changing relative to your current specs.
They use three sections:

#+begin_src markdown
# Delta for Books

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Book grouping by theme
The system SHALL display books grouped by their theme tag on the list page.

#### Scenario: Books with the same theme are grouped
- WHEN the user views the book list
- THEN books sharing a theme tag are displayed under a shared heading

#### Scenario: Books with no theme are grouped separately
- WHEN a book has no theme tag
- THEN it appears under an "Untagged" heading

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Add book form
The system SHALL include an optional theme tag field when adding a book.
(Previously: title, author, how-heard, expectations only)

#### Scenario: User adds a book with a theme
- WHEN the user submits the add-book form with a theme value
- THEN the book is stored with that theme tag

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Flat book list
(Superseded by grouped list view)
#+end_src

When you archive a change, OpenSpec processes these sections:
- *ADDED* requirements are appended to the main spec.
- *MODIFIED* requirements replace the existing version.
- *REMOVED* requirements are deleted from the main spec.

** Round 4: Implement via TDD
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-implement
:END:

*Goal*: turn the tasks into working, tested code.

1. Create a branch for the work, named after the phase:
   #+begin_src bash
   git checkout -b phase-2-data-layer
   #+end_src
   Branch naming convention: =phase-N-<short-description>=.
   One branch per logical phase of a change.

2. Start implementation:
   #+begin_example
   /opsx:apply
   #+end_example

The Developer persona will:
- Read =tasks.md= for the current phase.
- Write tests first (TDD), then make them pass.
- Check off completed tasks in =tasks.md=.
- Commit after each logical step.

*Best practices*:
- *One branch per change.* Do not mix multiple changes.
- *Smallest increments possible.* Each commit should be a single
  logical unit.
- *If the design is wrong*, do not push through. Edit
  =design.md= or =specs/= directly, then continue with
  =/opsx:apply=. The agent picks up the updated artifacts.
- *Comment all code.* Explain /why/, not /what/ (see
  STYLE_GUIDE.org).
- *No =any= types.* Strict TypeScript throughout.
- *Never swallow errors silently.* Validate at boundaries.

*** When Implementation Reveals Design Issues

This is the most important OPSX advantage over linear workflows.
If you discover mid-implementation that the design is wrong:

1. Edit the relevant artifact (=design.md=, =specs/=, or
   =tasks.md=) directly.
2. Run =/opsx:apply= again. The agent reads the updated
   artifacts.
3. No need to "go back to a phase". Just fix and continue.

** Round 5: Review
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-review
:END:

*Goal*: quality-gate the implementation.

After all tasks are checked off:

1. The Reviewer persona analyses the work:
   - Code correctness
   - Style adherence (STYLE_GUIDE.org)
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Test coverage

2. Produces =comments.md= with specific issues:
   - Line numbers where applicable
   - Whether to fix inline or refactor
   - Improvement recommendations

3. Developer addresses each comment.

*Repeat the Developer/Reviewer loop* until the Reviewer is
satisfied.

*Best practices*:
- Do not merge until the Reviewer approves.
- Keep the review focused. If scope creeps, start a new change.

** Round 6: Verify and Archive
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: round-archive
:END:

*Goal*: verify completeness and archive the finished work.

1. Verify the implementation matches the artifacts:
   #+begin_example
   /opsx:verify
   #+end_example
   This checks implementation across three dimensions:

   | Dimension    | What it validates                                               |
   |--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Completeness | All tasks done, all requirements implemented, scenarios covered |
   | Correctness  | Implementation matches spec intent, edge cases handled          |
   | Coherence    | Design decisions reflected in code, patterns consistent         |

   Example output:
   #+begin_example
   COMPLETENESS
   ✓ All 8 tasks in tasks.md are checked
   ✓ All requirements in specs have corresponding code
   ⚠ Scenario "Books with no theme are grouped separately" not tested

   CORRECTNESS
   ✓ Implementation matches spec intent
   ✓ Edge cases from scenarios are handled

   COHERENCE
   ✓ Design decisions reflected in code structure
   ⚠ Design specifies SQL GROUP BY but implementation groups in component

   Critical issues: 0  /  Warnings: 2  /  Ready to archive: Yes
   #+end_example

   Verify will not block archive, but it surfaces issues you
   may want to address first.

2. Sync delta specs to main specs if needed:
   #+begin_example
   /opsx:sync
   #+end_example

3. Archive the change:
   #+begin_example
   /opsx:archive my-feature-name
   #+end_example
   Merges delta specs into =openspec/specs/= and moves the
   change folder to =openspec/changes/archive/<date>-<name>/=
   for audit history.

4. Merge the branch:
   #+begin_src bash
   git checkout main
   git merge phase-2-data-layer
   #+end_src

* Decision Guide: Update vs. New Change

When your change evolves, decide whether to update or start
fresh:

| Situation                               | Action   | Reason                         |
|-----------------------------------------+----------+--------------------------------|
| Edge cases discovered                   | *Update* | Same intent, refined execution |
| Scope narrows to MVP                    | *Update* | Focused version of same goal   |
| Tech approach changes                   | *Update* | Learning-driven correction     |
| Codebase was not what you expected      | *Update* | Learning-driven correction     |
| Problem itself changes                  | *New*    | Different intent entirely      |
| Scope exploded beyond recognition       | *New*    | Essentially different work     |

** Concrete Example: "book-tracker-crud"

- "Let's also add search and filtering while we're at it" → *New change*
  (scope exploded; CRUD is completable without search).
- "node:sqlite API works differently than expected for transactions" → *Update*
  (same intent, learning-driven correction to the design).
- "Let's ship list + add first, edit/delete in a follow-up" → *Update*
  to scope the change to Phase 2–4, then archive, then new change for Phase 5.

The principle:
#+begin_quote
Update preserves context. New change provides clarity.

Choose update when the history of your thinking is valuable.
Choose new when starting fresh would be clearer than patching.
#+end_quote

* Quick Reference Card

** Typical Session Flow

#+begin_example
/opsx:explore          ← Think through the idea
/opsx:new my-feature   ← Formalise it
/opsx:ff               ← Generate all planning artifacts
                          (or /opsx:continue × 4 for incremental)
git checkout -b phase-N-description
/opsx:apply            ← Implement (TDD, small commits)
                          ← Review loop (Developer ↔ Reviewer)
/opsx:verify           ← Check completeness
/opsx:archive          ← Archive completed work
git checkout main && git merge phase-N-description
#+end_example

** Checking Status

#+begin_src bash
openspec status --change "my-feature"
#+end_src

Shows which artifacts are BLOCKED, READY, or DONE.

** Other Useful CLI Commands

#+begin_src bash
openspec list                    # List all active changes
openspec show my-feature         # View details of a change
openspec validate my-feature     # Validate spec formatting
openspec view                    # Open the interactive dashboard
#+end_src

** Complete Command Reference

| Command              | Purpose                        | When to Use                          |
|----------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~/opsx:explore~      | Think through ideas            | Unclear requirements, investigation  |
| ~/opsx:new~          | Start a change                 | Beginning any new work               |
| ~/opsx:continue~     | Create next artifact           | Step-by-step artifact creation       |
| ~/opsx:ff~           | Create all planning artifacts  | Clear scope, ready to build          |
| ~/opsx:apply~        | Implement tasks                | Ready to write code                  |
| ~/opsx:verify~       | Validate implementation        | Before archiving, catch mismatches   |
| ~/opsx:sync~         | Merge delta specs              | Optional — archive prompts if needed |
| ~/opsx:archive~      | Complete the change            | All work finished                    |
| ~/opsx:bulk-archive~ | Archive multiple changes       | Parallel work, batch completion      |

** Custom Schemas

If the default =spec-driven= schema does not fit your workflow:

#+begin_src bash
openspec schema init my-workflow    # Create from scratch
openspec schema fork spec-driven my-workflow  # Fork existing
openspec schema validate my-workflow  # Validate structure
#+end_src

Schemas live in =openspec/schemas/= (project-local) or
=~/.local/share/openspec/schemas/= (user-global).

* Common Pitfalls

- *Skipping explore*: jumping straight to =/opsx:new= without
  thinking the idea through leads to vague proposals and rework.
- *Monster changes*: keep each change focused on one feature.
  If scope creeps, archive and start a new change.
- *Ignoring context limits*: after ~100k tokens, restart the
  session. The AI degrades silently.
- *Pushing through bad design*: if implementation reveals the
  design is wrong, stop and fix the artifacts. OPSX makes this
  easy — use it.
- *Merging without review*: always run the Reviewer loop. It
  catches edge cases and style violations cheaply.
- *Not checking status*: run =openspec status= to see the
  current state of your change. It prevents confusion about
  what is ready.
- *Vague change names*: good names make =openspec list= useful.

  Good:                        Avoid:
  book-tracker-crud            feature-1
  fix-status-transition        update
  book-grouping-by-theme       changes
  add-book-expectations-field  wip
